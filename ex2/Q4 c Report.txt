Q4 c) 
    A different number of the combination "Linear-ReLU" was tested.
    
    The results are as follows:
    2 layers-network has reached 52% accuracy on the validation set,
    3 layers reached peaked at ninth epoch with 50.8% but went to 48.6 at 10th. Before the 9th epoch, a steady growth was shown.
    4 layers started from 11% and went to the slightly changing 7.8% during later epochs.
    5 layers has shown a performance which was very similar to the 4-layered version.
    
    Based on the results, we can assume that the models with 4 and 5 linear layers have overfit the data to such a degree that a random choice would fair better than these network on the validation set.
    
    The reason behind it is that the capacity of these two models was considerably higher when compared to the 3-layered model. Due to the insufficient amount of data, a system with such high capacity was not able to avoid overfitting.
    
    The best network configuration (2 layers) has shown accuracy 51.3 % on the 1000 test images.
